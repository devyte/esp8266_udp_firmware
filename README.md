# About

With this firmware, you can use an ESP8266 WiFi module for telemetry icw an UAS that runs Paparazzi autopilot code. To connect there are two option. The first is that the module can work as a client that connects to a Hotspot. For example, you can have the ESP module connect to the a same router as your computer. The second option is to set it up as a Router itself, then just connect your groundstation PC to this module.

# BOM

To make the modification one nees some 0402 SMD components:

- 5x 4k7 Resistor
- 1x 1k  Resistor
- 1x     Blue LED 

# Building

To create the module just buy a regular ESP09 module, available from many suppliers. Add (kapton) tape in the middle of the bottom of the module. It is the yellowishbrown square in the middle of the PCB. Prevents shorting on the four ground pads. Us skill and patience and solder the resistors and LED and I/O wires.

## Pico-ESP
There is also an very light and minimum sized Pico-ESP, developed at the MAVLab TUDelft. This module runs the very same software.

# Tools 

Installationthe following: 

- Download the latest stable Arduino IDE from the [Arduino website](http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). We used the Linux 64 version with good success.
- Enter ```http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json``` into *Additional Board Manager URLs* field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas. You can find it under menu  item File -> Preferences -> Settings
- Open Boards Manager from Tools -> Board menu and install *esp8266* platform.

# Configure
Configuring the ESP

- Within the Arduino IDE, select your ESP8266 board from Tools -> Board menu.
- Open `pprz_udp_link.ino`. There should also be a tab with `wifi_config.h`.
- In `wifi_config.h`, configure the settings of the hotspot you want to connect to.
- Also change the broadcastIP to the broadcast IP in your network. In Linux, you should be able to discover this by executing `ifconfig`. Look for `Bcast:*.*.*.*` for the wireless network interface (something like wlan*).

# Flashing

Basically:
- Upload the firmware to your ESP8266 by pressing the upload button.

But it needs to be in bootloader mode.. You have to connect GND with GPIO0 _while_ applying power!

## Flashing the firmware UART

The very first time, or if things are screwed up, the firmware needs to be flashed to the pico-esp using UART. Use a **3.3V** USB-to-Serial cable and connect Tx->Rx, Rx->Tx, Gnd->Gnd. 

It is usually better to use an external power source for the 3.3V. The 3.3V USB-to-Serial cables have only 3.3V on Rx and Tx, 
**the VCC is still 5V from USB which will damage your ESP**

### Pico ESP
To get the pico-esp in boot-mode, you have to connect GND with GPIO0 _while_ applying power. GPIO0 has no pin on the pico-esp, but just a very small patch at one corner.

When the Pico-ESP is in boot mode, the firmware can be flashed from the Arduino-IDE. See [README.md](https://github.com/paparazzi/esp8266_udp_firmware/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on getting the IDE. Use the following configuration for flashing.

## Updating firmware Over-The-Air

The firmware can be updated over WiFi. This should performed with care!. It is **crucial** to configure the WiFi correctly in the new firmware, otherwise you will not be able to establish a connection with the ESP and you will need to reprogram it over UART.

To update over the air, first you need a firmware image. In the Arduino-IDE, this can be generated from the menu Sketch->Export compiled Binary. This generates a binary image in the folder of the sketch.

In _Client_ mode, the Pico-ESP connects to a router. If your computer is connected to the same network, you can upload the firmware with the following command. This command contains the link to the **espota.py** tool which is part of the ESP Arduino package. The directory might be different on your system. Also update the path to the binary.

`python ~/.arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/2.1.0/tools/espota.py -i esp-module.local -r -f ~/git/esp8266_udp_firmware/pprz_udp_link/pprz_udp_link.cpp.generic.bin`

If you have configured the Pico-ESP in _AccesPoint_ mode, you can connect to the pico-esp with a laptop. The command is slightly different, since it now contains the IP of the module:

`python ~/.arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/2.1.0/tools/espota.py -i 192.168.4.1 -r -f ~/git/esp8266_udp_firmware/pprz_udp_link/pprz_udp_link.cpp.generic.bin`

# Airframe
In your airframe file, put the following configuration within the main AP`<firmware>` section:

```
<subsystem name="telemetry" type="transparent">
  <configure name="MODEM_BAUD" value="B115200"/>
  <configure name="MODEM_PORT" value="UART1"/>
</subsystem>
```
If you are using a different serial port on you autopilot board, change `UART1` accordingly.

# Connecting

WARNING: The module runs on **3.3V**, don't put 5V on it, 5V will destroy you board

To connect the module to your AP board:

- Connect VCC and GND, RX to TX, and TX to RX of the ESP09 board 

| ESP8266 | Autopilot |
| --- | --- |
| VCC | 3.3V |
| GND | GND |
| RX | TX |
| TX | RX |

# Testing

- Connect to you SSID of the module or let it connect to your router
- Start Paparazzi Center
- Select Tools -> Data Link
- Stop link
- Replace the command line options with "~/paparazzi/sw/ground_segment/tmtc/link **-udp**".
- Press [REDO] to restart link with the new parameters
- Wait a second...
- Enjoy telemetry over Wifi with Paparazzi

TIP: Data Messages can be simply viewed also with the.. message tool, see the Paparazzi Center tools menu.

# Documentation

Well, yes it is a opensource wiki and project. If you feel something is lacking, please add it, TIA

# Suggestions for improvement

Instead of flashing the module with a fixed SSID and password, it would be nice to have this configurable from the autopilot. Upon startup, the ESP8266 could send out requests for the SSID and password. A module within PPRZ could react by providing this in a PPRZ message format.
